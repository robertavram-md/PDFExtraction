Introduction
As the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were officially reported in China on 8
December 2019, this disease has rapidly spread to many other regions within China and
abroad [1]. As of 13 April 2020, over 1200000 confirmed COVID-19 patients have been
documented worldwide.
There are many similarities, indicated by the published literatures, between severe acute
respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS as well as MERS, such asthat
