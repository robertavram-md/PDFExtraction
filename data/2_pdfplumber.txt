time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived 
to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an in-
creased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 
10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those ≤65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those 
without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 
5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), 
cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 
1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 
5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and 
current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds 
ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found 
to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 
95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 
0.87 to 1.74).
CONCLUSIONS
Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascu-
lar disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients 
hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding 
a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in 
this clinical context. (Funded by the William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Ad-
