Abstract 
Background 
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and 
reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of 
hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.  
Patients and methods 
French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early 
March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in 
nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical 
presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center 
and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of 
virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. 
Results 
Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight 
had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. 
Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral 
carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration 
than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to 
hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. 
Conclusion                    
Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is 
significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its 
effect is reinforced by azithromycin.

1.  Introduction 
In late December 2019, an outbreak of an emerging disease (COVID-19) due to a novel 
coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2 latter) started in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in China 
and outside [1,2]. The WHO declared the epidemic of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 
12th 2020 [3]. According to a recent Chinese stud, about 80% of patients present with mild 
disease and the overall case-fatality rate is about 2.3% but reaches 8.0% in patients aged 70 to 
79 years and 14.8% in those aged >80 years [4]. However, there is probably an important 
number of asymptomatic carriers in the population, and thus the mortality rate is probably 
overestimated. France is now facing the COVID-19 wave with more than 4500 cases, as of 
March 14th 2020 [5]. Thus, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat 
symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus carriage in order to limit the 
transmission in the community. Among candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repositioning of 
old drugs for use as antiviral treatment is an interesting strategy because knowledge on safety 
profile, side effects, posology and drug interactions are well known [6,7]. 
A recent paper reported an inhibitor effect of remdesivir (a new antiviral drug) and 
chloroquine (an old antimalarial drug) on the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, [8] and an 
early clinical trial conducted in COVID-19 Chinese patients, showed that chloroquine had a 
significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance, when comparing to 
controls groups [9,10]. Chinese experts recommend that patients diagnosed as mild, moderate 
and severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine, be 
treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for ten days [11]. 
Hydroxychloroquine (an analogue of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an anti-
SARS-CoV activity in vitro [12]. Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than 
that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose [13] and has fewer                    
concerns about drug-drug interactions [14]. Our team has a very comprehensive experience in 
successfully treating patients with chronic diseases due to intracellular bacteria (Q fever due 
to Coxiella burnetii and Whipple’s disease due to Tropheryma whipplei) with long-term 
hydroxychloroquine treatment (600 mg/day for 12 to 18 months) since more than 20 years. 
[15,16] We therefore started to conduct a clinical trial aiming at assessing the effect of 
hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients after approval by the French Ministry 
of Health. In this report we describe our early results, focusing on virological data in patients 
receiving hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group. 
 
2.  Study population and Methods 
Setting 
This ongoing study is coordinated by The Méditerranée Infection University Hospital Institute 
in Marseille. Patients who were proposed a treatment with hydroxychloroquine were recruited 
and managed in Marseille centre. Controls without hydroxychloroquine treatment were 
recruited in Marseille, Nice, Avignon and Briançon centers, all located in South France.  
Patients 
Hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study if they fulfilled 
two primary criteria: i) age >12 years; ii) PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 carriage in 
nasopharyngeal sample at admission whatever their clinical status.  
Patients were excluded if they had a known allergy to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine or 
had another known contraindication to treatment with the study drug, including retinopathy, 
G6PD deficiency and QT prolongation. Breastfeeding and pregnant patients were excluded 
based on their declaration and pregnancy test results when required.                     
Informed consent 
Before being included in the study, patients meeting inclusion criteria had to  give their 
consent to participate to the study. Written informed signed consent was obtained from adult 
participants (> 18 years) or from parents or legal guardians for minors (<18 years). An 
information document that clearly indicates the risks and the benefits associated with the 
participation to the study was given to each patient. Patients received information about their 
clinical status during care regardless of whether they participate in the study or not. Regarding 
patient identification, a study number was assigned sequentially to included participants, 
according to the range of patient numbers allocated to each study centre. The study was 
conducted  in  accordance  with  the  International  Council  for  Harmonisation  of  Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines of good clinical practice, 
the Helsinki Declaration, and applicable standard operating procedures. 
The protocol, appendices and any other relevant documentation were submitted to the French 
National  Agency  for  Drug  Safety  (ANSM)  (2020-000890-25)  and  to  the  French  Ethic 
Committee (CPP Ile de France) (20.02.28.99113) for reviewing and approved on 5th and 6th 
March, 2020, respectively. This trial is registered with EU Clinical Trials Register, number 
2020-000890-25.  
Procedure 
Patients were seen at baseline for enrolment, initial data collection and treatment at day-0, and 
again for daily follow-up during 14 days. Each day, patients received a standardized clinical 
examination and when possible, a nasopharyngeal sample was collected. All clinical data 
were  collected  using  standardized  questionnaires.  All  patients  in  Marseille  center  were 
proposed oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during ten days (in this 
preliminary  phase  ,we  did  not  enrolled  children  in  the  treatment  group  based  in  data 
indicating that children develop mild symptoms of COVID-19 [4]). Patients who refused the                    
treatment or had an exclusion criteria, served as controls in Marseille centre. Patients in other 
centers did not receive hydroxychloroquine and served as controls. Symptomatic treatment 
and antibiotics as a measure to prevent bacterial super-infection was provided by investigators 
based on clinical judgment. Hydroxychloroquine was provided by the National Pharmacy of 
France on nominative demand. 
Clinical classification 
Patients were grouped into three categories: asymptomatic, upper respiratory tract infection 
(URTI) when presenting with rhinitis, pharyngitis, or isolated low-grade fever and myalgia, 
and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) when presenting with symptoms of pneumonia 
or bronchitis. 
PCR assay 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR [17].  
Hydroxychloroquine dosage 
Native hydroxychloroquine has been dosed from patients’ serum samples by UHPLC-UV 
using a previously described protocol [18]. The peak of the chromatogram at 1.05 min of 
retention corresponds to hydroxychloroquine metabolite. The serum concentration of this 
metabolite  is  deduced  from  UV  absorption,  as  for  hydroxychloroquine  concentration. 
Considering both concentrations provides an estimation of initial serum hydroxychloroquine 
concentration.  
 
 
                    
Culture 
For all patients, 500 µL of the liquid collected from the nasopharyngeal swab were passed 
through 0.22-µm pore sized centrifugal filter (Merck millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), then 
were inoculated in wells of 96-well culture microplates, of which 4 wells contained Vero E6 
cells (ATCC CRL-1586) in Minimum Essential Medium culture medium with 4% fetal calf 
serum and 1% glutamine. After centrifigation at 4,000 g, microplates were incubated at 37°C. 
Plates were observed daily for evidence of cytopathogenic effect. Presumptive detection of 
virus in supernatant was done using SU5000 SEM (Hitachi) then confirmed by specific RT-
PCR. 
Outcome 
The primary endpoint was virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion. Secondary outcomes 
were  virological  clearance  overtime  during  the  study  period,  clinical  follow-up  (body 
temperature, respiratory rate, long of stay at hospital and mortality), and occurrence of side-
effects.  
Statistics 
Assuming a 50% efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral load at day 7, a 85% 
power, a type I error rate of 5% and 10% loss to follow-up, we calculated that a total of 48 
COVID-19 patients (ie, 24 cases in the hydroxychloroquine group and 24 in the control 
group)  would  be  required  for  the  analysis  (Fleiss  with  CC).  Statistical  differences  were 
evaluated  by  Pearson’s  chi-square  or  Fisher’s  exact  tests  as  categorical  variables,  as 
appropriate. Means of quantitative data were compared using Student’s t-test. Analyses were 
performed in Stata version 14.2.  
                    
3.  Results (detailed results are available in supplementary Table 1) 
Demographics and clinical presentation  
We enrolled 36 out of 42 patients meeting the inclusion criteria in this study that had at least 
six days of follow-up at the time of the present analysis. A total of 26 patients received 
hydroxychloroquine and 16 were control patients. Six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients 
were lost in follow-up during the survey because of early cessation of treatment. Reasons are 
as follows: three patients were transferred to intensive care unit, including one transferred on 
day2 post-inclusion who was PCR-positive on day1, one transferred on day3 post-inclusion 
who was PCR-positive on days1-2 and one transferred on day4 post-inclusion who was PCR-
positive on day1 and day3; one patient died on day3 post inclusion and was PCR-negative on 
day2; one patient decided to leave the hospital on day3 post-inclusion and was PCR-negative 
on days1-2; finally, one patient stopped the treatment on day3 post-inclusion because of 
nausea and was PCR-positive on days1-2-3. The results presented here are therefore those of 
36 patients (20 hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and 16 control patients). None of the 
control patients was lost in follow-up. Basic demographics and clinical status are presented in 
Table  1.  Overall,  15  patients  were  male  (41.7%),  with  a  mean  age  of  45.1  years.  The 
proportion of asymptomatic patients was 16.7%, that of patients with URTI symptoms was 
61.1%  and  that  of  patients  with  LRTI  symptoms  was  22.2%).  All  patients  with  LRTI 
symptoms, had confirmed pneumonia by CTScan. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were 
older than control patients (51.2 years vs. 37.3 years). No significant difference was observed 
between  hydroxychloroquine-treated  patients  and  control  patients  with  regard  to  gender, 
clinical  status  and  duration  of  symptoms  prior  to  inclusion  (Table  1).  Among 
hydroxychloroquine-treated  patients  six  patients  received  azithromycin  (500mg  on  day1 
followed by 250mg per day, the next four days) to prevent bacterial super-infection under                    
daily electrocardiogram control. Clinical follow-up and occurrence of side-effects will be 
described in a further paper at the end of the trial.  
Hydroxychloroquine dosage 
Mean hydroxychloroquine serum concentration was 0.46 µg/ml+0.2 (N=20).  
Effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral load 
The proportion of patients that had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples 
significantly differed between treated patients and controls at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion 
(Table 2). At day6 post-inclusion, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were 
virologicaly cured comparing with 12.5% in the control group (p= 0.001).  
When comparing the effect of hydroxychloroquine treatment as a single drug and the effect of 
hydroxychloroquine and azithromyc in combination, the proportion of patients that had 
negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples was significantly different between the two 
groups at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion (Table 3). At day6 post-inclusion, 100% of patients 
treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination were virologicaly cured 
comparing with 57.1% in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only, and 12.5% in the 
control group (p<0.001). These results are summarized in Figures 1 and 2. Drug effect was 
significantly higher in patients with symptoms of URTI and LRTI, as compared to 
asymptomatic patients with p<0.05 (data not show).  
Of note, one patient who was still PCR-positive at day6-post inclusion under 
hydroxychloroquine treatment only, received azithromycin in addition to hydroxychloroquine 
at day8-post inclusion and cured her infection at day-9 post infection. In contrast, one of the 
patients under hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination who tested negative at 
day6 post-inclusion was tested positive at low titer at day8 post-inclusion.                    
Cultures 
We could isolate SARS-CoV-2 in 19 out of 25 clinical samples from patients. 
 
4.  Discussion 
For ethical reasons and because our first results are so significant and evident we decide to 
share our findings with the medical community, given the urgent need for an effective drug 
against SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic context. 
We show here that hydroxychloroquine is efficient in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage 
of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in only three to six days, in most patients. A 
significant difference was observed between hydroxychloroquine-treated patients and controls 
starting even on day3 post-inclusion. These results are of great importance because a recent 
paper has shown that the mean duration of viral shedding in patients suffering from COVID-
19 in China was 20 days (even 37 days for the longest duration) [19] 
Very recently, a Chinese team published results of a study demonstrating that chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with hydroxychloroquine 
(EC50=0.72%µM) found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47%µM) [14]. These 
in vitro results corroborate our clinical results. The target values indicated in this paper [14] 
were reached in our experiments. The safer dose-dependent toxicity profile of 
hydroxychloroquine in humans, compared to that of chloroquine [13] allows using clinical 
doses of hydroxychloroquine that will be over its EC50 observed in vitro [14]. 
Our preliminary results also suggest a synergistic effect of the combination of 
hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Azithromycin has been shown to be active in vitro 
against Zika and Ebola viruses [20-22] and to prevent severe respiratory tract infections when                    
administrated to patients suffering viral infection [23]. This finding should be further explored 
to know whether a combination is more effective especially in severe cases. Speculated 
potential risk of severe QT prolongation induced by the association of the two drugs has not 
been established yet but should be considered. As for each treatment, the cost benefits of the 
risk should be evaluated individually. Further studies on this combination are needed, since 
such combination may both act as an antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and prevent 
bacterial super-infections.  
The cause of failure for hydroxychloroquine treatment should be investigated by testing the 
isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains of the non-respondents and analyzing their genome, and by 
analyzing the host factors that may be associated with the metabolism of hydroxychloroquine. 
The  existence  of  hydroxychloroquine  failure  in  two  patients  (mother  and  son)  is  more 
suggestive of the last mechanism of resistance. 
Such results are promising and open the possibility of an international strategy to decision-
makers to fight this emerging viral infection in real-time even if other strategies and research 
including vaccine development could be also effective, but only in the future. We therefore 
recommend that COVID-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to 
cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb 
the spread of COVID-19 in the world. Further works are also warranted to determine if these 
compounds could be useful as chemoprophylaxis to prevent the transmission of the virus, 
especially for healthcare workers. Our study has some limitations including a small sample 
size, limited long-term outcome follow-up, and dropout of six patients from the study, 
however in the current context, we believe that our results should be shared with the scientific 
community.
