Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect people with 
cardiovascular disease. Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful 
effect of angiotensin-convertingŒenzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-recep
-tor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.
METHODS
Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North 
America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy 
with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admit
-ted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the 
Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or 
survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.
RESULTS
Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the 
time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived 
to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an in
-creased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 
10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those ˜65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those 
without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 
5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), 
cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 
1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 
5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and 
current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds 
ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found 
to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 
95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 
0.87 to 1.74).
CONCLUSIONS
Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascu
-lar disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients 
hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding 
a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in 
this clinical context. (Funded by the William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Ad

As the coronavirus disease 2019 
(Covid-19) pandemic has spread around 
the globe, there has been growing recog
-nition that persons with underlying increased 
cardiovascular risk may be disproportionately 
affected.
1-3
 Several studies of case series have 
noted cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and 
cardiac arrest as terminal events in patients with 
Covid-19.
1-4
 Higher incidences of cardiac arrhyth
-mias, acute coronary syndromes, and heart fail
-ureŒrelated events have also been reported during 
seasonal influenza outbreaks, which suggests that 
acute respiratory infections may result in activa
-tion of coagulation pathways, proinflammatory 
effects, and endothelial cell dysfunction.
5 In ad
-dition, however, concern has been expressed that 
medical therapy for cardiovascular disease might 
specifically contribute to the severity of illness 
in patients with Covid-19.
6,7
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Covid-19, 
has been shown to establish itself in the host 
through the use of angiotensin-converting en
-zyme 2 (ACE2) as its cellular receptor.
8 ACE2 is 
a membrane-bound monocarboxypeptidase found 
ubiquitously in humans and expressed predomi
-nantly in heart, intestine, kidney, and pulmonary 
alveolar (type II) cells.
7,9
 Entry of SARS-CoV-2 
into human cells is facilitated by the interaction 
of a receptor-binding domain in its viral spike 
glycoprotein ectodomain with the ACE2 receptor.
10ACE2 is counterregulatory to the activity of 
angiotensin II generated through ACE1 and is 
protective against detrimental activation of the 
reninŒangiotensinŒaldosterone system. Angioten
-sin II is catalyzed by ACE2 to angiotensin-(1Œ7), 
which exerts vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, an
-tifibrotic, and antigrowth effects.
11 It has been 
suggested that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-
receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the expres
-sion of ACE2, which has been shown in the heart 
in rats,
12 and thereby may confer a predisposition 
to more severe infection and adverse outcomes 
during Covid-19.
6,7
 Others have suggested that 
ACE inhibitors may counter the antiinflammatory 
effects of ACE2. However, in vitro studies have 
not shown direct inhibitory activity of ACE in
-hibitors against ACE2 function.
9,13
Despite these uncertainties, some have rec
-ommended cessation of treatment with ACE in
-hibitors and ARBs in patients with Covid-19.
6 However, several scientific societies, including 
the American Heart Association, the American 
College of Cardiology, the Heart Failure Society 
of America, and the Council on Hypertension of 
the European Society of Cardiology, have urged 
that these important medications should not be 
discontinued in the absence of clear clinical evi
-dence of harm.
14,15
 We therefore undertook a study 
to investigate the relationship between underlying 
cardiovascular disease and Covid-19 outcomes and 
to evaluate the association between cardiovascular 
drug therapy and mortality in this illness.
Methods
Data Source
We analyzed deidentified data from the Surgical 
Outcomes Collaborative (Surgisphere), an interna
-tional registry. Our analysis included data from 
169 hospitals located in 11 countries in Asia, 
Europe, and North America. The collaborative uses 
automated extraction of data from inpatient and 
outpatient electronic health records, supply-chain 
databases, and financial records, combined with 
point-of-care data entry for procedures. A manual 
data-entry process is used for quality assurance 
and validation. Data are collected through auto
-mated data transfers that capture information 
from each health care entity at regular intervals 
on a prospective, ongoing basis. Verifiable source 
documentation for the data elements includes elec
-tronic inpatient and outpatient medical records.
Data acquisition is facilitated through the use 
of a standardized Health Level SevenŒcompliant 
data dictionary. After this data dictionary is har
-monized with data from electronic health records, 
the majority of the data acquisition is completed 
with automated interfaces. The collected data 
sample from each health care entity is validated 
against financial records and external databas
-es. All protected health information is stripped 
from each record before storage in a cloud-based 
data warehouse. The collaborative is compliant 
with the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality guidelines for registries and the Food and 
Drug Administration guidance on real-world evi
-dence. The collection and analysis of data in the 
registry have been deemed exempt from ethics 
review.
Data Collection
The collaborative registry was used as a resource 
to analyze data from all patients with polymerase-
 n engl j med   
nejm.org 3Cardiovascular Disease in Covid-19
chain-reaction (PCR)Œproven Covid-19 who were 
admitted to the hospital between December 20, 
2019, and March 15, 2020, and who were re
-corded in the registry as having either died in 
the hospital or survived to hospital discharge as 
of March 28, 2020. Data from the registry can be 
analyzed only after a patient™s hospitalization is 
complete, and therefore our sample did not in
-clude patients who were admitted to the hospital 
during this time window but were still hospital
-ized at the end of it. Our sample also may have 
excluded some patients who had died or were 
discharged by March 28 but whose discharge 
status had not yet been recorded by the hospital.
The presence in the record of a positive labo
-ratory finding confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection 
was used for classifying a patient as positive for 
Covid-19. A positive laboratory finding for SARS-
CoV-2 was defined as a positive result on high-
throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-tran
-scriptaseŒPCR (RT-PCR) assay of nasal or 
pharyngeal swab specimens. At each site, Covid-19 
was diagnosed on the basis of the World Health 
Organization guidance.
16 Patients who did not 
undergo testing, had no record of testing in the 
collaborative database, or had a negative test 
were not included in the present study. For this 
study, only one positive test was necessary for 
the patient to be included in the analysis.
Data on patients™ demographic characteris
-tics, coexisting conditions (based on codes from 
the 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revi
-sion, Clinical Modification
), and cardiovascular drug 
therapy were included in this analysis. Clinical 
information included age, sex, continent of ori
-gin, and underlying coexisting conditions as 
noted in either the inpatient or the outpatient 
electronic health record. Coexisting conditions 
included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), an immunosuppressed condition (glu
-cocorticoid use, a preexisting immunologic con
-dition, or ongoing chemotherapy in patients 
with cancer), current or remote history of smok
-ing, and a history of hypertension, diabetes mel
-litus, hyperlipidemia, or underlying cardiovascu
-lar disease (including coronary artery disease, 
heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmia). Cardio
-vascular drug therapy recorded at the time of 
hospital admission was also included, including 
any antiplatelet therapy, use of insulin or other 
hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, statins, ARBs, 
and ACE inhibitors.
All the authors reviewed the manuscript and 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data provided.
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis was an evaluation of the 
relationship of preexisting cardiovascular dis
-ease and drug therapy with the end point of in-
hospital death while controlling for confound
-ers, including demographic characteristics and 
coexisting conditions. Categorical variables are 
shown as frequencies and percentages, and con
-tinuous variables as means and standard devia
-tions. Independent sample t-tests were complet
-ed, and point differences with 95% confidence 
intervals are reported for all comparisons be
-tween variables. Multiple imputation for missing 
values was not possible because for disease and 
drug variables there were no codes to indicate 
that data were missing; if the patient™s elec
-tronic health record did not include information 
on a clinical characteristic, such as hyperlipid
-emia or the use of beta-blockers, it was assumed 
that that characteristic was not present.
A multivariable logistic-regression analysis 
was performed to ascertain the effects of age, 
race, coexisting conditions (coronary artery dis
-ease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhyth
-mia, diabetes mellitus, COPD, current smoking, 
former smoking, hypertension, immunocompro
-mised state, and hyperlipidemia), hospital loca
-tion (according to country), and medications 
(ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, antiplate
-let agents, statins, insulin, and oral hypoglyce
-mic agents) on the likelihood of in-hospital 
death. Linearity of the continuous variables with 
respect to the logit of the dependent variable was 
confirmed. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals were calculated. Separate 
age- and sex-adjusted analyses were also per
-formed. The 95% confidence intervals have not 
been adjusted for multiple testing and should 
not be used to infer definitive effects.
On the basis of the results of the initial 
analyses, additional analyses were performed to 
examine the robustness of the estimates initially 
obtained. Analyses according to continent of ori
-gin as well as country classification (as either high 
income or lowŒmiddle income) were performed. 
A tipping-point analysis (an analysis that shows 
the effect size and prevalence of an unmeasured 
confounder that could shift the upper boundary 
 n engl j med   
nejm.org 4The
 new england journal 
of medicine
of the confidence interval toward null) was per
-formed. In addition, we sought to determine 
whether the effect of ACE inhibitors and statins 
noted in the overall study was also seen when 
the analysis was confined to a subgroup of pa
-tients who might have an indication for these 
agents. Thus, the association of ACE inhibitor 
use with in-hospital death was examined in the 
subgroup of patients with hypertension, and the 
association of statin use with in-hospital death 
was examined in the subgroup of patients with 
hyperlipidemia, with the use of age- and sex-
adjusted logistic-regression analysis. All statistical 
analyses were performed with R software, version 
3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), 
and SPSS Statistics software, version 26 (IBM).
Results
Patients
Our study population included 8910 hospitalized 
patients from 169 hospitals who had Covid-19, 
who were admitted between December 20, 2019, 
and March 15, 2020, and who completed their 
hospital course (discharged alive or died) by March 
28, 2020. Patients who were hospitalized during 
this time without a completed course could not 
be included in the analysis. Our sample was 
made up of 1536 patients (17.2%) from North 
America, 5755 (64.6%) from Europe, and 1619 
(18.2%) from Asia (details of the study popula
-tion according to continent, country, and num
-ber of hospitals are provided in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org). The mean (±SD) 
age was 49±16 years (16.5% of the patients were 
>65 years of age), 40.0% of the patients were 
women, 63.5% were white, 7.9% were black, 6.3% 
were Hispanic, and 19.3% were Asian.
With respect to cardiovascular risk factors, 
30.5% of the patients had hyperlipidemia, 26.3% 
had hypertension, 14.3% had diabetes mellitus, 
16.8% were former smokers, and 5.5% were cur
-rent smokers. Preexisting cardiovascular disease 
in this sample included coronary artery disease 
(present in 11.3% of the patients), a history of con
-gestive heart failure (2.1%), and a history of cardiac 
arrhythmia (3.4%). Other coexisting conditions 
included COPD (in 2.5% of the patients) and an 
underlying immunosuppressed condition (2.8%). 
Medical therapy included ACE inhibitors (8.6% 
of the patients), ARBs (6.2%), statins (9.7%), 
beta-blockers (5.9%), and antiplatelet agents (3.3%). 
Insulin was used in 3.4% of the patients, and 
other hypoglycemic agents were used in 9.6%. 
The mean length of hospital stay was 10.7±2.7 
days, with an overall in-hospital mortality of 
5.8% (515 of 8910 patients) in this population of 
patients with completed outcomes. Of the pa
-tients who had been admitted to an intensive care 
unit (ICU) at any time during their hospitaliza
-tion, 24.7% died, as compared with 4.0% of the 
patients who had not been admitted to an ICU.
Analysis of Survivors as Compared 
 with Nonsurvivors
Table
 1 shows the distribution of demographic 
characteristics and coexisting conditions among 
survivors and nonsurvivors, along with the be
-tween-group differences and 95% confidence in
-tervals. Nonsurvivors were older, more likely to be 
white, and more often men, and they had a 
greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hyperlip
-idemia, coronary artery disease, heart failure, 
and cardiac arrhythmias. Patients who died were 
also more likely to have had COPD and a history 
of current smoking. Among medications, ACE in
-hibitors and statins were more commonly used by 
survivors than by nonsurvivors (Table
 2), whereas 
no association between survival and the use of 
ARBs was found. The length of hospital stay dif
-fered between survivors and nonsurvivors (10.5±2.5 
days vs. 7.5±2.8 days). When the data were ana
-lyzed according to age decile, continent, or in
-come category of the country in which the hos
-pital was located (high income or lowŒmiddle 
income), the results were similar (Fig. S1 and 
Tables S2 and S3).
Multivariable Logistic-Regression Analysis
A multivariable logistic-regression model was 
developed. Independent predictors of in-hospital 
death and their corresponding odds ratios and 
95% confidence intervals are shown in Figure
 1. 
An age greater than 65 years, coronary artery 
disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhyth
-mia, COPD, and current smoking were associat
-ed with a higher risk of in-hospital death. Fe
-male sex, the use of ACE inhibitors, and the use 
of statins were associated with a better chance 
of survival to hospital discharge, with no associa
-tion found for the use of ARBs. For female sex, 
 n engl j med   
nejm.org 5Cardiovascular Disease in Covid-19
the odds ratio for dying in the hospital was 0.79 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.95); for 
ACE inhibitor use, the odds ratio was 0.33 (95% 
CI, 0.20 to 0.54); and for statin use, the odds 
ratio was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.52). For ARB 
use, the odds ratio was 1.23 (95% CI, 0.87 to 
1.74). The presence or absence of an immuno
-suppressed condition, the race or ethnic group, 
and the presence or absence of hyperlipidemia 
or diabetes mellitus were not independent pre
-dictors of death in the hospital. The analyses 
according to continent and according to the in
-come category of the country (high or lowŒmiddle) 
were consistent with the overall results (Tables 
S4 and S5). Data from the age- and sex-adjusted 
multivariable logistic-regression analyses are 
shown in Table S6.

Additional Analyses
In the tipping-point analysis to assess the poten
-tial effect of an unmeasured confounder, it was 
estimated that a hypothetical unobserved binary 
confounder with a prevalence of 10% in the study 
population would need to have an odds ratio of 
at least 10 in order for the observed associations 
for either ACE inhibitors or statins to have 95% 
confidence intervals crossing the odds ratio 
boundary of 1.0 (Table S7). We also separately 
examined the interaction of ACE inhibitor use 
with mortality in the subgroup with hyperten
-sion and the interaction of statin use with mor
-tality in the subgroup with hyperlipidemia. These 
analyses, shown in Table S8, are consistent with 
the results of the primary analysis.
Discussion
Our investigation confirms previous reports of 
the independent relationship of older age, under
-lying cardiovascular disease (coronary artery dis
-ease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias), cur
-rent smoking, and COPD with death in Covid-19. 
Our results also suggest that women are propor
-tionately more likely than men to survive the 
infection. Neither harmful nor beneficial asso
-ciations were noted for antiplatelet therapy, beta-
blockers, or hypoglycemic therapy. It is important 
to note that we were not able to confirm previous 
concerns regarding a potential harmful associa
-tion of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-
hospital mortality in this clinical context.
In viral infections such as influenza, older 
age is associated with an increased risk of car
-diovascular events and death.
5 In the 2003 epi
-demic of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS, caused by SARS-CoV-1 infection), sex 
differences in the risk of death similar to those 
we observed were noted.
17 Women have stronger 
innate and adaptive immunity and greater resis
-tance to viral infections than men.
18 In animal 
models of SARS-CoV-1 infection, higher suscep
-tibility of male mice to SARS-CoV-1 and greater 
accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils 
in the lungs have been described.
19 Ovariectomy 
or the use of estrogen-receptor antagonists 
increased mortality from SARS-CoV-1 infection 
in female animals. Furthermore, the difference in 
risk between the sexes increased with advancing 
age.
19 These findings may support the observa
-tion in our investigation that suggested an as
-sociation between survival and female sex, inde
-pendent of older age.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a mild disease 
in most people, but in some the disease pro
-gresses to a severe respiratory illness character
-ized by a hyperinflammatory syndrome, multi
-organ dysfunction, and death.
20 In the lung, the 
viral spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts 
with cell-surface ACE2, and the virus is internal
-ized by endocytosis. The endocytic event up-
regulates the activity of ADAM metallopeptidase 
domain 17 (ADAM17), which cleaves ACE2 from 
the cell membrane, resulting in a loss of ACE2-
mediated protection against the effects of activa

tion of the tissue reninŒangiotensinŒaldosterone 
system while mediating the release of proin
-flammatory cytokines into the circulation.
21 The 
stress of critical illness and inflammation may 
unite in destabilizing preexisting cardiovascular 
illness. Vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, in
-flammation-associated myocardial depression, 
stress cardiomyopathy, direct viral infection of 
the heart and its vessels, or the host response may 
cause or worsen heart failure, demand-related isch
-emia, and arrhythmias.
22 These factors may under
-lie the observed associations between cardiovascu
-lar disease and death in Covid-19.
In our analyses, use of either ACE inhibitors 
or statins was associated with better survival 
among patients with Covid-19. However, these as
-sociations should be considered with extreme cau
-tion. Because our study was not a randomized, 
controlled trial, we cannot exclude the possibility 
of confounding. In addition, we examined rela
-tionships between many variables and in-hospi
-tal death, and no primary hypothesis was pre
-specified; these factors increased the probability 
of chance associations being found. Therefore, a 
cause-and-effect relationship between drug ther
-apy and survival should not be inferred. These 
data also offer no information concerning the 
potential effect of initiation of ACE inhibitor or 
statin therapy in patients with Covid-19 who do 
not have an appropriate indication for these 
medications. Randomized clinical trials evaluat
-ing the role of ACE inhibitors and statins will be 
necessary before any conclusion can be reached 
regarding a potential benefit of these agents in 
patients with Covid-19.
In this multinational observational study in
-volving patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we 
confirmed previous observations suggesting that 
underlying cardiovascular disease is independently 
associated with an increased risk of in-hospital 
death. We were not able to confirm previous con
-cerns regarding a potential harmful association 
of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital mor
-tality in this clinical context.
