Background.
 We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported cases of˜coronavirus disease 201
9 (COVID-19) in 
Jiangsu Province.
Methods.
 We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of con˚rmed cases of COVID-19 
with World Health Organization interim guidance in 3 grade IIIA hospitals of Jiangsu from 22 January to 14 February 2020. Real-
time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples.
Results.
 Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 were female, with a median age of 46.1˜years. Except for 3 severe pa
-tients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. Nine patients were uncon˚rmed until a third nucleic acid 

test; 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. ˛e main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which ac
-counted for 63 (78.75%) and 51 (63.75%) cases, respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination 
showed that 55 patients (68.75%) showed abnormal density shadow and 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the 

parenchyma of both lungs. Currently, 21 cases have been discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. ˛e average length of 

stay for discharged patients was 8˜days.
Conclusions.
 Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious 
gender susceptibility
. ˛e proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that 

in Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on 2 consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid 

test results.
Keywords.
  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); clinical characteristics; imported cases; pneumonia.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been re
-cently identified to be caused by a type of B-coronavirus 

[1]. The virus has
 enveloped virions that appear as round or 
oval, often polymorphous, with a diameter of 60Œ140˜nm 
[2]. It is widely distributed in human and other mam
-
mals, and its genome is mor
e distant from severe acute 

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [
3, 4]  and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS 
CoV) [
5, 6]. Since December 2019, a large number of COVID-
19˜patients have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province 

[7Œ9]. Most of them work in or live around the local Huanan 
seafood wholesale market, where wild animals are illegally on 
sale. Severe symptoms of acute respiratory infection appeared 

within the early stage of this pneumonia, with exacerbating 

cases where patients developed acute respiratory distress syn
-
drome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagula
-
tion dysfunction, which are difficult to correct [
10].As of 14 February 2020, 66˜577 cases have been con˚rmed in 
China, including 54˜406 cases in Hubei Province, 37˜914 cases in 

Wuhan City, including medical sta˝, and several exported cases 

in ˛ailand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, the United States, 
Australia, and other countries. Considering its highly conta
-gious˜nature, COVID-19 has been categorized as a class B in
-
fectious disease stipulated in the law of the People™s Republic of 

China on the prevention and control of infectious diseases for 

the ˚rst time, and is managed as class A˜infectious disease [

 Ł Wu et˜al
So far, several studies have described the epidemiological and 
clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, but they are 
all limited to cases in Wuhan and not in other areas [
12, 13]. In 
this study, the clinical characteristics of 80 patients diagnosed 

with COVID-19 in 3 grade IIIA hospitals of Jiangsu Province 
are discussed. We believe our ˚ndings will provide further de
-tails to the epidemic situation and clinical characteristics of this 

novel coronavirus.
METHODSPatientsAll enrolled 80 patients, who were referred to the First People™s 

Hospital of Yancheng City, the Second People™s Hospital of 

Yancheng City, and the Fifth People™s Hospital of Wuxi from 22 

January to 14 February were retrospectively and consecutively 

analyzed. According to the arrangements by the Chinese
 gov
-ernment, all 3 tertiary hospitals provide treatment for all pa
-
tients who were diagnosed as having COVID-19 according to
 
World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance [
14]. We 

collected all the data including clinical, demographic, labora
-
tory parameters; chest computed tomography (CT); length of 

hospitalization and intensive care unit stay; and prognosis from 

patients™ medical records and attending doctors. The data end
-point was 14 February 2020. The present study was performed in 
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by 

the Ethics Committee of the First People™s Hospital of Yancheng 

City. Written informed consent was obtained from participants 

or their families when data were collected retrospectively.
According to WHO Interim Guidance [
14], cases in this 
study were de˚ned as anyone with the following epidemiolog
-
ical history and consistent with any 2 clinical manifestations 

and the pathogenic evidence:
 1. Epidemiological history: (1) within 14˜days before the onset 
of the disease, there were tourism or residence histories in 

Wuhan or its surrounding areas, or other communities with 

confirmed cases; (2) within 14˜days before the onset of the 

disease, there were contacts with confirmed cases of COVID-

19; (3) within 14˜days before the onset of the disease, there 

were contacts with suspected cases (having fever or respi
-
ratory symptoms) from Wuhan or its surrounding areas, or 

other communities with confirmed cases; (4) aggregationŠ

within 14˜days before the onset of the disease, 1 confirmed 

case was found in an enclosed environment (eg, a family 

house, a construction site, an office) with 1 or more cases 
of fever respiratory tract infection found at the same time, 
revealing potential interpersonal transmission or joint expo
-
sure of the disease.
 2. Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symp
-toms; (2) imaging indicates multiple mottling and interstitial 

changes in the lung periphery during the early stage, which 
subsequently developed into bilateral ground-glass opacity, 

infiltrates, and lung consolidation; pleural effusion was rarely 

seen; (3) in the early stage of the disease, the total number 

of leukocytes was normal or decreased, or the lymphocyte 

count was decreased.
 3. Pathogenic evidence: the nucleic acid test was used to detect 
the new coronavirus in respiratory˜fluid
.The patients were clinically classified into 4 types: mild, mod
-erate, severe, or critically ill. The criteria for clinical classifica
-tions are shown in 
Supplementary Table 1
.Strategy for Nucleic Acid˜Tests
Once a suspected case was admitted to the hospital, the nu
-
cleic acid test was carried out immediately. A˜nose swab and/or 

throat swab were taken from each patient. The nucleic acid test 

was considered positive if the result of either of the above sam
-
ples was positive. If it was negative, the samples would be taken 
once a day for the next 2˜days.
A˙er the treatment, if the patient™s condition improved sig
-ni˚cantly and there were no respiratory symptoms of fever or 
cough, the patient would be discharged a˙er passing 2 consec
-
utive nucleic acid tests.
Detection of Coronavirus A˜total of 150˜µL of sample from throat swab and/or nose swab 

of each patient was used to extract total RNA. On the basis of the 

manufacturer™s instructions, total RNA extracted using the res
-
piratory sample RNA isolation kit (Zhongzhi, Wuhan, China) 

and each sample obtained 40˜ˆL elution. In order to target the 
nucleocapsid (N) gene and open reading frame lab (ORF1ab) 
gene using a 2019 novel coronavirus
 nucleic acid detection re
-
agent (Bio-germ, Shanghai, China), we used real-time reverse 

transcriptaseŒpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR
) with 5˜ˆL 

RNA. The final reaction mixture concentrations of primer and 

probe were 500˜nm and 200˜nm, respectively. The sequences 

used and real-time RT-PCR performance conditions are listed 

in Supplementary Table 2
.˛e lowest detection concentration is 1˜

3 copies/mL. 
˛ere was no cross-reaction with inˇuenza A˜virus H1N1, 

H1N1 (2009), H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, inˇuenza B virus (BV and 

BY types), human coronavirus (229E/HKU1/OC43/NL63/

SARS/MERS), parainˇuenza virus (1, 2, 3), or rhinovirus 

A/B/C. No more than 50% blood and less than 0.9˜mg/mL of 

mucin in the sample will not cause interference.
Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed with SPSS (version18.0; 

SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). If the continuous measurement is a 

normal distribution, we present it as a mean (±SD); if it is not 

a normal distribution, we present it as a median (interquartile

RESULTS
Demographics, Baseline, and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With COVID-19In this study, 80 cases with COVID-19 in Yancheng City and 
Wuxi City were investigated, including 5 families. All these 

cases were imported infections (with an epidemiological his
-
tory of Wuhan) and had no contact with Huanan seafood 

market in Wuhan. None of these patients were medical staff. 
Among them, 41 patients (51.25%) were female, with a me
-dian age of 46.1˜years (IQR, 30.7Œ61.5). Twenty-seven patients 

(33.75%) were aged 25Œ49˜years, 19 patients (23.75%) were 

aged 50Œ64˜years, 15 patients (18.75%) were aged 18Œ24˜years, 

10 patients (12.50%) were under 18˜years old, and 9 patients 

(11.25%) were over 65˜years old (
Figure˜1
). Of the 10 patients 

under 18˜years old, the minimum age was 4, 2 patients were 
between 6 and 8˜years old, and 6 patients were between 11 and 
13˜years; the maximum age was 14. In term of clinical classifica
-
tion, 28 (35.00%) patients were mild type, 49 (61.25%) patients 

were moderate type, 3 (3.75%) patients were severe type, and no 

patient was critically ill. During the diagnostic procedure, we 

found that 41 patients (51.25%) had a positive result in the first 

test, and 30 patients (37.50%) had a positive result in the second 

test. Surprisingly, another 9 patients (11.25%) remained nega
-
tive until a third test. Of all the 80 patients, 38 cases (47.50%) 
had a history of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases, endocrine system diseases, digestive 

system diseases, respiratory system diseases, malignant tumors, 

and nervous system diseases (
Table˜1
).˛e most common symptoms were fever and cough, which 
accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (63.75%), 
respectively. ˛irty cases (37.50%) had shortness of breath. In 

addition, 18 (22.50%) patients had muscle ache, 13 patients 

(16.25%) had headache and mental disorder symptoms, and 

no patients had hemoptysis or diarrhea symptoms. ˛e av
-
erage time from onset to the emergence of shortness of breath 

was 8.0˜days (IQR, 5.0Œ13.0). Except for 10 patients (12.50%) 

with acute respiratory injury and 2 patients (2.50%) with renal 

injury, there was no other organ damage (

.Laboratory Findings of Patients With COVID-19The white blood cell (WBC) count of 36 patients (45.00%) was 

lower than the normal range (4
 ˜ 109/L), and 26 patients (32.50%) 
had lymphocytopenia (the lymphocyte count was <1.0˜
˜ 109/L). 
Eleven patients (13.75%) had platelets lower than the normal 

range (125˜
˜ 10
9/L), and no patients had platelets higher than 
the normal range (350˜
˜ 109/L). There were 62 patients (77.50%) 
with high C-reactive protein (CRP) and 59 patients (73.75%) 
with a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Only 1 patient 
(1.25%) had an elevated procalcitonin (PCT)˜level.
In terms of liver function, only 3 patients (3.75%) showed al
-anine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 

above the normal range. Two patients (2.50%) had a lower al
-
bumin level than the normal range (35˜g/L). Eighteen patients 

(22.50%) had an abnormal myocardial enzyme spectrum, 

indicating an increase in creatine kinase (CK). ˛e level of lac
-
tate dehydrogenase (LDH) was increased in 17 patients (21.25%). 

Two patients (2.50%) had di˝erent degrees of renal function 
damage, one of them had serious renal function damage (Urea: 
26.5˜mmol/L, creatinine [CREA]: 1054.4˜mmol/L). ˛e blood 

glucose (GLU) level of 19 patients (23.17%) exceeded the normal 

range (5.9˜mmol/L). ˛e level of D-dimer was increased in 3

).Imaging Features of Patients With COVID-19Of the 80 patients, 55 (68.75%) showed abnormal chest CT im
-
ages, consisting of 36 cases (45.00%) of bilateral pneumonia 

and 19 cases (23.75%) of unilateral pneumonia (
Table˜1
). There 
were no bilateral lobular and subsegmental consolidation areas, 

bilateral ground-glass shadows, or subsegmental consolidation 
areas, and only bilateral ground-glass opacity (
Figure˜2A
) and 
unilateral ground-glass opacity (
Figure˜2B
). Twenty-five cases 

(31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma 

of both lungs (
Figure˜2C
).Treatment for Patients With COVID-19
All patients were treated empirically with a single antibi
-
otic, mainly moxifloxacin. The duration of antibiotic treat
-
ment was 3Œ12˜days (median, 7˜days; IQR, 4Œ9). All patients 

received ribavirin antiviral therapy for 3Œ12˜days (median, 

7˜days; IQR, 3Œ10). Twelve patients (14.63%) also received 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate or methylprednisolone 
for 3Œ12˜days (median, 5˜days; IQR, 3Œ8). Thirty-five patients 

(43.75%) were managed with a noninvasive ventilator (ie, face 

mask). No patient used an invasive ventilator. One patient was 

supported with hemodialysis. In addition, 3 patients used tradi
-
tional Chinese medicine (Jian Wei Xiao Shi oral liquid, Jichuan 

Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Taixing, China˜and X
i Yan 

Ping, Jiangxi Qingfeng Pharmaceutical Co. LTD, Ganzhou, 

China) to improve their gastrointestinal function.
Prognosis of Patients With COVID-19As of 14 February, 21 of the 80 patients (23.75%) had been dis
-
charged from the hospital. The average length of stay of discharged 

patients was 8˜days. All other patients were still in the hospital for 

treatment, and no patient died. The discharge standard reference 

was as follows: body temperature returned to normal for more 
than 3˜days, respiratory symptoms improved significantly, and

-secutive times (sampling interval at least 1˜day).
DISCUSSIONIn this multicenter, multi-sample study, 80 cases with COVID-

19 in Yancheng and Wuxi were reported. All patients had im
-
ported infections. Most of them received a timely diagnosis 

and treatment as the government formulated an efficient early-

warning and isolation program in time. Except for 3 severe pa
-tients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate 
symptoms. This report provides the latest information on in
-fected patients in 2 cities of Jiangsu Province.
COVID-19 was mainly transmitted through respiratory drop
-lets and contact [
15]. At present, patients with COVID-19 are the 

main source of infection [
16]. What is more remarkable is that 

asymptomatic infections can also be a source of infection [
17]. ˛e 

2 cities mentioned in this study, Wuxi and Yancheng, are respec
-
tively located in the South and North of Jiangsu Province, and they 

are representative in population, economic level, and tra˘c˜level.
Compared with the results of the 2 studies on Wuhan cases 
by Chen et˜al [
18] and Huang et˜al [
19], we found that the 

gender proportion was equal in the 80 patients we included, 
contradicting the conclusion that men are more susceptible 

than women. ˛is may be related to the insu˘cient number of 

samples in these 3 studies. ˛e results may also be inˇuenced 

by the spreading mode of the disease, as 5 cases of intrafamilial 

transmission were included in this study. ˛e age distribution of 

the patients was consistent with the study by Huang et˜al [
19].In terms of clinical classi˚cation, 3 patients had severe pneu
-monia, and 77 patients had mild or moderate symptoms. ˛ese 

imported cases diagnosed in a timely fashion and treated in 
Jiangsu Province. Since most of the cases in this study were 
mild, the main symptoms were fever and cough. Ten patients 
had acute respiratory injury, 2 patients had renal injury, and no 
other organ damage was˜found.
In terms of laboratory tests, nearly half of the patients had a 
decreased number of WBCs and one-third of the patients had 
a decreased number of lymphocytes. In most patients, the CRP 

level was elevated but the PCT level was normal. All of these 

changes further illustrated that COVID-19 may exert a major 

impact on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. ˛e virus 

spreads and invades through respiratory mucosa, triggers a se
-
ries of immune responses, and induces the multiple cytokine-

release syndrome, resulting in changes in immune components

such as peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes [
20]. ˛erefore, intravenous immunoglobulins were used in most 

patients with decreased WBC and lymphocyte levels.
It has been reported that patients with COVID-19 infection 
are prone to exhibit liver dysfunction, and the potential mech
-anism is that COVID-19 may directly bind to angiotensin-
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
-positive bile duct cells [
21, 22]. It is suggested that the liver abnormality of patients with SARS 

and COVID-19 may not be caused by liver cell damage but by 

bile duct cell dysfunction and other reasons. In our study, 3 pa
-
tients had abnormal ALT and AST, and 2 patients had decreased 
protein levels. In addition, 19 patients had an elevated GLU 

level, and 18 patients had an abnormal muscle zymogram.
In this study, all cases were con˚rmed by nucleic acid test. 
˛e total nucleic acid tests prior to a positive diagnosis for each 

patient were analyzed. Notably, 9 
patients passed 3 tests before 
they received positive results. ˛erefore, we consider that if the 
suspected cases are excluded based on 2 consecutively negative 

respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results (the sampling 

time is at least 1˜day apart), approximately 10% of the infected 

patients will be missed.
Chest imaging is of great signi˚cance for the diagnosis [
23]. In the early stage, there were multiple mottling and interstitial 

changes, especially in the peripheral portion. In severe cases, 

lung consolidation can occur, but pleural e˝usion was rare. In 
the case reports of Wuhan, CT images of all patients were ab
-normal; 98% of the patients had bilateral involvement. However, 

in our study, the abnormal rate was relatively lower; 55 patients 

(68.75%) showed abnormal chest CT images, 36 (45.00%) 

showed bilateral pneumonia, 19 (23.75%) showed unilateral 

pneumonia. 25 cases had no abnormality on the ˚rst CT, and 

23 of them had been diagnosed for more than 4˜days. In this 
regard, we suggest that, when screening patients, clinical mani
-festations, laboratory examination, and chest imaging should be 

combined for comprehensive analysis.
Currently
, there is no speci˚c drug for the treatment of 
patients with COVID-19 [
24, 25]. A˜US study showed that 
remdesivir had good therapeutic e˝ect [
26]. China has now car
-ried out preliminary clinical trials on this drug [
27]. Currently, 

the clinical treatment mainly includes empirical antibacterial 

drugs, antiviral treatment with ribavirin
, and an appropriate 
dose of methylprednisolone to alleviate the shortness of breath. 
At the same time, it is suggested to use traditional Chinese med
-
icine properly to improve the physical signs of patients. In this 

study, as there was no critical case, no patient used an invasive 

ventilator. All 3 hospitals followed the above scheme. At pre
-
sent, 21 cases have been discharged from the hospital, with an 

average length of stay of 8˜days, no death was reported, and all 

other patients were still in the hospital.
˛is study is limited by its retrospective nature. First, due to 
the limited number of patients, our conclusions need to be fur
-ther veri˚ed by large samples and multicenter data. Second, the 

prognosis is unavailable at the time of analysis, and extended 

follow-up time would provide more detailed information about 
potential risk factors that interfere with clinical outcomes. 
˛ird, only 2 cities in Jiangsu Province were selected in this 

study. Although they are representative, more urban cases need 

to be included to make the research results more accurate.
In conclusion, in-depth study is still needed for patients with 
COVID-19. Reliable, rapid pathogen detection and practical 

di˝erential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial 

for clinicians to contact suspected patients for the ˚rst time, and 

it is urgent to develop virus vaccines and e˝ective drugs.
